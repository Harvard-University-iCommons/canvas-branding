/* For learning assets from dart.harvard.edu that are
   embedded in Canvas modules, ensure that the height
   of the iframe is never smaller than the maximum
   height of the iframe source content.

   This code prevents an additional scrollbar from being
   created when Canvas renders a ExternalURL iframe
   with a height smaller than 800px.
